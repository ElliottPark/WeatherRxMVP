WeatherRxMVP

This app demonstrates the MVP architecture using RxAndroid and RxJava. It makes heavy use of functional reactive programming for asynchronous API calls. It maintains view state after screen rotation and does notreissue new API calls if the device is rotated while and API call is being made.

NOTE: This app hits the Weather Underground API and requires an API key in order to work.
